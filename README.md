A recreation of Arkhamnetwork's HUB.

During my "recreation" of Arkhamnetwork's HUB(s), I pretended I owned a domain named (arkham.network).
So links that are advertised are null.

On the scoreboard, the 'total joined' is a string and isn't auto incrementing.
However, the 'player count' adjust according with the spoofed players "online".
